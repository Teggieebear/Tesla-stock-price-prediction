# Tesla-stock-price-prediction
This aim of this project is to carry out an analysis on the price of Tesla stocks between 2010 and 2020 to see how the price of Tesla stocks increased overtime, and then build a Linear regression model to predict the closing price of the Tesla stock.
The Tesla stock data from 2010 to 2020 was used for this project.
